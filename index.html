                The state of American politics rests amidst a strange equilibrium: cognizant of nation-wide, structural issues, but incapable of enacting targeted reforms. The past years' discussions surrounding criminal justice were no exception. While most can identify what terms like systemic racism entail in the abstract, hardly anyone can grasp the scope of how far structural injustice pervades every American institution. This project aims to pull that curtain back: to examine the legislative causes and symptoms of systemic racism in the United States.

                The first component of systemic racism is its most visible—the racial wealth gap. While white colonists were able to accumulate wealth throughout the early history of the United States, Black families were prohibited from profiting off of their labor. The result is a centuries-long cap on the economic growth of Black communities.<br>
                <br>
                This ceiling was created by 246 years of chattel slavery, which erased the ability for African Americans to accumulate lifetime wealth. Even after its abolishment, incidents like Tulsa's Greenwood District Massacre and the collapse of the Freedman's Savings Bank undermined economic recovery. Such tragedies were amplified by discriminatory federal legislation—like the G.I. Bill, the New Deal's protection extemptions, and Jim Crow segregation

                One of the symptoms of the racial wealth gap is the lack of generational wealth in African-American communities. Black families not only have less wealth compared to white households, but also inherit less. White households are twice as likely to receive an inheritance; and on average, an inheritance increases a white household's net wealth by $104,000, compared to only $4,000 among Black ones.

                Less overt forms of economic inequality in employment exist to this day. Black men earn less then equally qualified white men across all occupations; in fact, they're the only racial group that does not achieve occupational parity at any level. (They only earn 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns.
                ) This institutionalized inequality also contributes to the devaluation of Black households, which are worth 60% less than their white counterparts.

                The racial wealth gap is only one part of the story. Post-abolition, government-sponsored housing segregation stunted the economic recovery of Black communities. From the 1930's onwards, banks often dliberately denied mortages to people of color. This practice—dubbed "redlining" for its colored markers—created cities capable of segregation sans overt enforcement. The results were devastating: Black communities lost out on $212,000 per household in personal wealth.

            <p id="slide6_content_2">The legacy of redlining is painfully visible to this day. It's the reason Black communities are often crowded into under-developed areas of urban landscapes, where job opportunities, educational facilities, and public services barely exist. Meanwhile, majority-white communities thrive in the suburbs, in areas that were inaccessible to Black people until the 21st century.</p>

                Redlining might be a relatively known phenomenon, but its impacts on Black communities are far more insidious—and covert. Where you live determines everything from your education to your physical fitness, a fact that Black Americans are reminded of daily. Because of decades-old redlining, over 50% of children are still forced into segregated schools, where over 75% of students are either white or non-white.
                                <br><br>
                In addition, because of the devaluation of Black property via property taxes, non-white schools are terminally behind their counterparts. School districts that serve predominantly students of color receive $23 billion less in funding than mostly white school districts, despite serving the same amount of students.

                The consequences of housing discrimination don't stop at schooling. Redlining is also responsible for the existence of food deserts: areas where healthy meal options are inaccessible for miles. These urban pockets are devoid of fresh produce or nutritional options, instead favoring pre-packaged junk.<br>
                <br>
                The result is a disturbing inequalities in health outcomes: Black Americans are 51% more likely to be obese, as compared to their white counterparts.

                Perhaps the most sinister effect of redlining is its invisible perpetuation of environmental racism. In the 1900's, local governments refused to invest in parks and other natural resources, creating adverse health outcomes in Black neighborhoods. Black children in America are twice as likely to develop asthma as their peers, and African-American neighborhoods are exposed to 50% more pollution than white ones.

                <br>In 1838, America's police force was created to capture fugitive slaves and return them to the horrors of the plantation; and even in the 21st century, its effect remains the same among Black communities.

                Police brutality is just one symptom of a structurally racist criminal justice system. Incarceration rates rates are equally skewed.<br>
                <br>
                Not only are Black Americans more likely to be racially profiled by the police, they're also more likely to be convicted of crimes they didn't commit. African Americans are incarcerated in state prisons across the country at more than 5 times the rate of whites.

                In 2014, more than 2.3 million Black males were part of the prison population. In fact, 1 in every 3 Black males born today will go to prison at some point in their lives.

                Thanks to three-strikes legislation, the War on Drugs, and manatory minimums, Black males are also more likely to have a criminal record than everything from a bachelor's degree to military service.

                But the results of mass incarceration stretch far beyond the sentence itself—and they're often covert as well. Black males with criminal records are often disqualified from employment, health insurance, and gun ownership, effectively relegating them to a second-class citizen. Convicted felons also lose the right to vote in most states, erasing any potential for reform. Almost 7.4% of the adult Black population is disenfranchised, compared to 1.8% of the rest of the country. That's 1 in 13 Black Americans who will never be able to vote again.
