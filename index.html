                Amidst this year's Black Lives Matter protests and the national conversation surrounding police brutality, one phrase was repeated over and over again - "systemic racism." But while most people might know what the term entails in the abstract, hardly anyone can grasp the scope of how far structural injustice pervades every American institution. For Black Americans, inequality is a daily reality; but for the rest of us, it's a shadowy construct that's invisible to the naked eye. This website aims to pull that curtain back - to examine the veiled causes and symptoms of systemic racism in the United States.<br>

                The first component of systemic racism is its most visible - the racial wealth gap. While white colonists were able to accumulate wealth throughout the early history of the United States, Black families were prohibited from profiting off of their labor. The result is a centuries-long cap on the economic growth of Black communities.<br>
                <br>
                This ceiling was created by 246 years of chattel slavery, which erased the ability for African Americans to accumulate lifetime wealth. Even after its abolishment, incidents like Tulsa's Greenwood District Massacre and the collapse of the Freedman's Savings Bank undermined economic recovery. Such tragedies were amplified by discriminatory federal legislation - like the G.I. Bill, the New Deal's protection extemptions, and Jim Crow segregation

                One of the symptoms of the racial wealth gap is the lack of generational wealth in African-American communities. Black families not only have less wealth compared to white households but also inherit less. White households are twice as likely to receive an inheritance; and on average, an inheritance increases a white household's net wealth by $104,000, compared to only $4,000 among Black ones.

                While it may be hard to see, systemic racism in employment exists today too. Black men earn less then equally qualified white men across all occupations; in fact, they're the only racial group that does not achieve occupational parity at any level. (They only earn 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns.

                The racial wealth gap is only one part of the story. In addition to rigging economic opportunities, the federal government also participated in deliberate housing segregation - the effects of which are often hard to spot. From the 1930's onwards, banks in America denied people of color mortgages in upscale areas. This practice - dubbed "redlining" for its colored markers - was backed by the feds, creating segregated cities without the need for overt enforcement. The results were devastating - Black communities lost out on $212,000 per household in personal wealth thanks to the practice.

            <p id="slide6_content_2">The legacy of redlining is painfully visible to this day. It's the reason Black communities are often crowded into under-developed areas of urban landscapes, where job opportunities, educational facilities, and public services barely exist. Meanwhile, majority-white communities thrive in the suburbs, in areas that were inaccessible to Black people until the 21st century.</p>

                Whereas redlining is a relatively known phenomenon, its impacts on Black communities lie below the immediate surface. Where you live determines everything from your education to physical fitness - a fact Black Americans are reminded of daily. Because of redlining, over 50% of American kids are still forced into segregated schools anually, where over 75% of students are either white or non-white.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, because of the devaluation of Black property via property taxes, non-white schools are terminally behind their counterparts. School districts that serve predominantly students of color receive $23 billion less in funding than mostly white school districts, despite serving the same amount of students.

                The consequences of housing discrimination don't stop at schooling. Redlining is also responsible for the existence of food deserts - areas where groceries and healthy meal options are inaccessible for miles. These urban pockets are devoid of fresh produce or nutritional options, instead favoring copious amounts of pre-packaged junk.<br>
                <br>
                The result is a disturbing rate of inequality in diseases like obesity - Black Americans are 51% more likely to be obese as compared to their white counterparts.

                the reasons are obvious. Because of redlining's denial of loans to newer businesses in "undesirable" communities decades ago, Black Americans are now forced to fight for the most basic of human rights.

                Perhaps the most sinister effect of redlining is its invisible perpetuation of environmental inequality. In the 1900's, local governments refused to invest in parks and other natural resources, creating adverse health outcomes in Black neighborhoods. Black children in America are twice as likely to develop asthma as their peers, and African-American neighborhoods are exposed to 50% more pollution than white ones.

                Police brutality is just one symptom of a structurally racist criminal justice system. If Black people are lucky enough to avoid police escalation, the fate that awaits most is little better.<br>
                <br>
                Not only are Black Americans more likely to be racially profiled by the police, they're also more likely to be convicted of crimes they didn't commit. African Americans are incarcerated in state prisons across the country at more than 5 times the rate of whites.

                In 2014, more than 2.3 million Black males were part of the prison population. In fact, 1 in every 3 Black males born today will go to prison at some point in their lives.

                Thanks to three-strikes legislation, the War on Drugs, and manatory minimums, Black males are also more likely to have a criminal record than everything from a bachelor's degree to military service.

                But the results of mass incarceration stretch far beyond the sentence itself - and they're often covert as well. Black males with criminal records are often disqualified from employment, health insurance, and gun ownership, effectively relegating them to a second-class citizen. Convicted felons also lose the right to vote in most states, erasing any potential for reform. Almost 7.4% of the adult Black population is disenfranchised, compared to 1.8% of the rest of the country. That's 1 in 13 Black Americans who will never be able to vote again.

                As with every other facet of systemic inequality in America, mass incarceration is also a product of racial stigma - in this case, in sentencing disparities. Black men who commit the same crimes as white men recieve federal prison sentences that are nearly 20% longer.

                In addition, Black offenders are 75% more likely to face a charge carrying a mandatory minimum sentence than a white offender who committed the same crime.

                This disparity is present at every division of the criminal justice system. 22% of Black defendants who kill white victims are executed; meanwhile, only 8% of non-Black defendants are given the same treatment.

                Black men are sentenced on drug charges 13.4 times more than white men.

                Even homicides involving Black victims are 23% less likely to result in a conviction.

            <p id="slide13_content">
                This is the reality that Black Americans face - a reality filled with omnipresent danger and little opportunity for escape. Unfortunately, education's only part of the path to ending systemic racism. Even if we know about the oft-hidden dangers of being Black in America, systematic change is still out of reach as of now.<br>
